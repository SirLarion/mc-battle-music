### Minecraft Battle Music mod

How many times have you entered a raid, ready to give your life to protect the
Mending Villager that you spent hours grinding for, and then suddenly you hear
the first signature tones of "Wet hands" (superb song, BTW) ?

How many times have you been on your third hour of mining with half a stack of
diamonds and an inventoryfull of other goodies, when suddenly your shield breaks
on a skeleton's arrow and you realize that a bunch of mobs have crept up on you
without you noticing? All you can hear is the grunts of zombies and the faint
clackety-clack of your keyboard through your headphones.

"Battle Music" is a Minecraft mod that automatically starts playing appropriate
music when entering intensive battle situations or when a battle takes a turn
for the worse. Battle Music will give you the glory you deserve when sh*t hits
fan and you're ready to fight your way out of it.
